<p>We present a state-of-the-art report on visualization in astrophysics. We survey representative papers from both astrophysics and visualization and provide a taxonomy of existing approaches based on data analysis tasks. The approaches are classified basedon  five  categories:  data  wrangling,  data  exploration,  feature  identification,  object  reconstruction,  education  and  outreach. Our  unique  contribution  is  to  combine  the  diverse  viewpoints  from  both  astronomers  and  visualization  experts  to  identify challenges and opportunities for visualization in astrophysics. The main goal is to provide a reference point to bring modern data analysis and visualization techniques to the rich datasets in astrophysics. </p>
