        "abstract": "Data on the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant from NASA and other sources have been rendered into a three-dimensional virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) programme, which is the first of its kind. This data-driven experience of a supernova remnant allows viewers to take a virtual walk inside the leftovers of a massive star that has exploded, select parts of the remnant to engage with and access descriptive texts on what the different materials are. This programme is based on a unique three-dimensional (3D) model of the 340-year old remains of a stellar explosion, made by combining data from NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Spitzer Space Telescope and ground-based facilities. A collaboration between the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and Brown University allowed the 3D astronomical data collected on Cassiopeia A to be featured in the VR/AR programme, which is an innovation in digital technologies with public, education and research-based impacts.",

        "abstract": "New tools are needed to handle the growth of data in astrophysics delivered by recent and upcoming surveys. We aim to build open-source, light, flexible, and interactive software designed to visualize extensive three-dimensional (3D) tabular data. Entirely written in the Python language, we have developed interactive tools to browse and visualize the positions of galaxies in the universe and their positions with respect to its large-scale structures (LSS). Motivated by a previous study, we created two codes using Mollweide projection and wedge diagram visualizations, where survey galaxies can be overplotted on the LSS of the universe. These are interactive representations where the visualizations can be controlled by widgets. We have released these open-source codes that have been designed to be easily re-used and customized by the scientific community to fulfill their needs. The codes are adaptable to other kinds of 3D tabular data and are robust enough to handle several millions of objects.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we address the challenge of seamlessly visualizing astronomical data exhibiting huge scale differences in distance, size, and resolution. One of the difficulties is accurate, fast, and dynamic positioning and navigation to enable scaling over orders of magnitude, far beyond the precision of floating point arithmetic. To this end we propose a method that utilizes a dynamically assigned frame of reference to provide the highest possible numerical precision for all salient objects in a scene graph. This makes it possible to smoothly navigate and interactively render, for example, surface structures on Mars and the Milky Way simultaneously. Our work is based on an analysis of tracking and quantification of the propagation of precision errors through the computer graphics pipeline using interval arithmetic. Furthermore, we identify sources of precision degradation, leading to incorrect object positions in screen\u2010space and z\u2010fighting. Our proposed method operates without near and far planes while maintaining high depth precision through the use of floating point depth buffers. By providing interoperability with order\u2010independent transparency algorithms, direct volume rendering, and stereoscopy, our approach is well suited for scientific visualization. We provide the mathematical background, a thorough description of the method, and a reference implementation.",

        "abstract": "The Montage Image Mosaic Engine was designed as a scalable toolkit, written in C for performance and portability across *nix platforms, that assembles FITS images into mosaics. This code is freely available and has been widely used in the astronomy and IT communities for research, product generation, and for developing next-generation cyber-infrastructure. Recently, it has begun finding applicability in the field of visualization. This development has come about because the toolkit design allows easy integration into scalable systems that process data for subsequent visualization in a browser or client. The toolkit it includes a visualization tool suitable for automation and for integration into Python: mViewer creates, with a single command, complex multi-color images overlaid with coordinate displays, labels, and observation footprints, and includes an adaptive image histogram equalization method that preserves the structure of a stretched image over its dynamic range. The Montage toolkit contains functionality originally developed to support the creation and management of mosaics, but which also offers value to visualization: a background rectification algorithm that reveals the faint structure in an image; and tools for creating cutout and downsampled versions of large images. Version 5 of Montage offers support for visualizing data written in HEALPix sky-tessellation scheme, and functionality for processing and organizing images to comply with the TOAST sky-tessellation scheme required for consumption by the World Wide Telescope (WWT). Four online tutorials allow readers to reproduce and extend all the visualizations presented in this paper.",

        "abstract": "Human knowledge about the cosmos is rapidly increasing as instruments and simulations are generating new data supporting the formation of theory and understanding of the vastness and complexity of the universe. OpenSpace is a software system that takes on the mission of providing an integrated view of all these sources of data and supports interactive exploration of the known universe from the millimeter scale showing instruments on spacecrafts to billions of light years when visualizing the early universe. The ambition is to support research in astronomy and space exploration, science communication at museums and in planetariums as well as bringing exploratory astrographics to the class room. There is a multitude of challenges that need to be met in reaching this goal such as the data variety, multiple spatio-temporal scales, collaboration capabilities, etc. Furthermore, the system has to be flexible and modular to enable rapid prototyping and inclusion of new research results or space mission data and thereby shorten the time from discovery to dissemination. To support the different use cases the system has to be hardware agnostic and support a range of platforms and interaction paradigms. In this paper we describe how OpenSpace meets these challenges in an open source effort that is paving the path for the next generation of interactive astrographics.",

        "abstract": "We present a new Python library, called vaex, intended to handle extremely large tabular datasets such as astronomical catalogues like the Gaia catalogue, N-body simulations, or other datasets which can be structured in rows and columns. Fast computations of statistics on regular N-dimensional grids allows analysis and visualization in the order of a billion rows per second, for a high-end desktop computer. We use streaming algorithms, memory mapped files, and a zero memory copy policy to allow exploration of datasets larger than memory, for example out-of-core algorithms. Vaex allows arbitrary (mathematical) transformations using normal Python expressions and (a subset of) numpy functions which are \u201clazily\u201d evaluated and computed when needed in small chunks, which avoids wasting of memory. Boolean expressions (which are also lazily evaluated) can be used to explore subsets of the data, which we call selections. Vaex uses a similar DataFrame API as Pandas, a very popular library, which helps migration from Pandas. Visualization is one of the key points of vaex, and is done using binned statistics in 1d (e.g. histogram), in 2d (e.g. 2d histograms with colourmapping) and 3d (using volume rendering). Vaex is split in in several packages: vaex-core for the computational part, vaex-viz for visualization mostly based on matplotlib, vaex-jupyter for visualization in the Jupyter notebook/lab based in IPyWidgets, vaex-server for the (optional) client-server communication, vaex-ui for the Qt based interface, vaex-hdf5 for HDF5 based memory mapped storage, vaex-astro for astronomy related selections, transformations, and memory mapped (column based) FITS storage.",

Environment is an important factor in the evolution of galaxies from actively forming stars to quiescent states with little, if any, discernible star formation activity. The gaseous halos of galaxies (the circumgalactic medium, or CGM) play a critical role in their evolution, because the gas necessary to fuel star formation and any gas expelled from widely observed galactic winds must encounter this interface region between galaxies and the intergalactic medium (IGM). We present a taxonomy of tasks typically employed in IGM/CGM studies informed by a survey of astrophysicists at various career levels, and demonstrate how these tasks are facilitated via the use of our visualization software. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of IGM-Vis through two in-depth use cases that depict real-world analysis sessions that use IGM/CGM data.",

        "abstract": "We introduce The Fabric of the Universe, an art and science collaboration focused on exploring the cosmic web of dark matter with unconventional techniques and materials. We discuss two of our projects in detail. First, we describe a pipeline for translating three-dimensional (3D) density structures from N-body simulations into solid surfaces suitable for 3D printing, and present prints of a cosmological volume and of the infall region around a massive cluster halo. In these models, we discover wall-like features that are invisible in two-dimensional projections. Going beyond the sheer visualization of simulation data, we undertake an exploration of the cosmic web as a three-dimensional woven textile. To this end, we develop experimental 3D weaving techniques to create sphere-like and filamentary shapes and radically simplify a region of the cosmic web into a set of filaments and halos. We translate the resulting tree structure into a series of commands that can be executed by a digital weaving machine, and present a large-scale textile installation.",

They encompass a collection of platforms dedicated to the storage and dissemination of astronomical data, from simple data archives to e-research platforms offering advanced tools for data exploration and analysis. Whilst the more mature platforms within VOs primarily serve the observational community, there are also services fulfilling a similar role for theoretical data. Scientific visualization can be an effective tool for analysis and exploration of data sets made accessible through web platforms for theoretical data, which often contain spatial dimensions and properties inherently suitable for visualization via e.g. mock imaging in 2D or volume rendering in 3D. We analyse the current state of 3D visualization for big theoretical astronomical data sets through scientific web portals and virtual observatory services. We discuss some of the challenges for interactive 3D visualization and how it can augment the workflow of users in a virtual observatory context. Finally we showcase a lightweight client\u2013server visualization tool for particle-based data sets, allowing quantitative visualization via data filtering, highlighting two example use cases within the Theoretical Astrophysical Observatory.",

With a datacube as input, the software can generate a volume rendering of the 3D data, show the evolution of a simulation in time, and do a fly-around camera animation to highlight the points of interest. We explain the process to import simulation outputs into Blender using the voxel data format, and how to set up a visualization scene in the software interface. This method allows scientists to perform a complementary visual analysis of their data and display their results in an appealing way, both for outreach and science presentations.",

We find that Orion A is not the fairly straight filamentary cloud that we see in (2D) projection, but instead a cometary-like cloud oriented toward the Galactic plane, with two distinct components: a denser and enhanced star-forming (bent) Head, and a lower density and star-formation quieter \u223c75 pc long Tail. The true extent of Orion A is not the projected \u223c40 pc but \u223c90 pc, making it by far the largest molecular cloud in the local neighborhood. Its aspect ratio (\u223c30:1) and high column-density fraction (\u223c45%) make it similar to large-scale Milky Way filaments (\u201cbones\u201d), despite its distance to the galactic mid-plane being an order of magnitude larger than typically found for these structures.",

        "abstract": "Reconstructing 3D distributions from their 2D projections is a ubiquitous problem in various scientific fields, particularly so in observational astronomy. In this work, we present a new approach to solving this problem: a Vienna inverse-Abel-transform based object reconstruction algorithm AVIATOR. The reconstruction that it performs is based on the assumption that the distribution along the line of sight is similar to the distribution in the plane of projection, which requires a morphological analysis of the structures in the projected image. The output of the AVIATOR algorithm is an estimate of the 3D distribution in the form of a reconstruction volume that is calculated without the problematic requirements that commonly occur in other reconstruction methods such as symmetry in the plane of projection or modelling of radial profiles. We demonstrate the robustness of the technique to different geometries, density profiles, and noise by applying the AVIATOR algorithm to several model objects. In addition, the algorithm is applied to real data: We reconstruct the density and temperature distributions of two dense molecular cloud cores and find that they are in excellent agreement with profiles reported in the literature. The AVIATOR algorithm is thus capable of reconstructing 3D distributions of physical quantities consistently using an intuitive set of assumptions.",

        "abstract": "In the last decades cosmological N-body dark matter simulations have enabled ab initio studies of the formation of structure in the Universe. Gravity amplified small density fluctuations generated shortly after the Big Bang, leading to the formation of galaxies in the cosmic web. These calculations have led to a growing demand for methods to analyze time-dependent particle based simulations. Rendering methods for such N-body simulation data usually employ some kind of splatting approach via point based rendering primitives and approximate the spatial distributions of physical quantities using kernel interpolation techniques, common in SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics)-codes. This paper proposes three GPU-assisted rendering approaches, based on a new, more accurate method to compute the physical densities of dark matter simulation data. It uses full phase-space information to generate a tetrahedral tessellation of the computational domain, with mesh vertices defined by the simulation's dark matter particle positions. Over time the mesh is deformed by gravitational forces, causing the tetrahedral cells to warp and overlap. The new methods are well suited to visualize the cosmic web. In particular they preserve caustics, regions of high density that emerge, when several streams of dark matter particles share the same location in space, indicating the formation of structures like sheets, filaments and halos. We demonstrate the superior image quality of the new approaches in a comparison with three standard rendering techniques for N-body simulation data.",

Following an analysis of the application domain, we design a client-server architecture to fetch distributed image data and to partition local data into a spatial index structure that allows prefix-matching of spatial objects. In conjunction with hardware-accelerated pixel-based overlays and an online cross-registration pipeline, this approach allows the fetching, displaying, panning and zooming of gigabit panoramas of the sky in real time. To further facilitate the integration and mining of spatial and non-spatial data, we introduce interactive trend images-compact visual representations for identifying outlier objects and for studying trends within large collections of spatial objects of a given class. In a demonstration, images from three sky surveys (SDSS, FIRST and simulated LSST results) are cross-registered and integrated as overlays, allowing cross-spectrum analysis of astronomy observations. Trend images are interactively generated from catalog data and used to visually mine astronomy observations of similar type. The front-end of the infrastructure uses the web technologies WebGL and HTML5 to enable cross-platform, web-based functionality. Our approach attains interactive rendering framerates; its power and flexibility enables it to serve the needs of the astronomy community. Evaluation on three case studies, as well as feedback from domain experts emphasize the benefits of this visual approach to the observational astronomy field; and its potential benefits to large scale geospatial visualization in general.",

Here, I present AstroBlend, an open-source Python library for use within the three dimensional modeling software, Blender. While Blender has been a popular open-source software among animators and visual effects artists, in recent years it has also become a tool for visualizing astrophysical datasets. AstroBlend combines the three dimensional capabilities of Blender with the analysis tools of the widely used astrophysical toolset, yt, to afford both computational and observational astrophysicists the ability to simultaneously analyze their data and create informative and appealing visualizations. The introduction of this package includes a description of features, work flow, and various example visualizations. A website --- www.astroblend.com --- has been developed which includes tutorials, and a gallery of example images and movies, along with links to downloadable data, three dimensional artistic models, and various other resources.",

At the extragalactic distance scales, visualization is contributing to our understanding of the complex structure of the local universe in terms of spatial distribution and flows of galaxies and dark matter. In this paper, we report advances in the field of extragalactic cosmography obtained using the SDvision visualization software in the context of the Cosmicflows Project. Here, multiple visualization techniques are applied to a variety of data products: catalogs of galaxy positions and galaxy peculiar velocities, reconstructed velocity field, density field, gravitational potential field, velocity shear tensor viewed in terms of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, envelope surfaces enclosing basins of attraction. These visualizations, implemented as high-resolution images, videos, and interactive viewers, have contributed to a number of studies: the cosmography of the local part of the universe, the nature of the Great Attractor, the discovery of the boundaries of our home supercluster of galaxies Laniakea, the mapping of the cosmic web, and the study of attractors and repellers.",

One aspect of particular interest to scientists is the evolution of groups of dark matter particles, or \"halos,\" described by merger trees. However, in order to fully understand subtleties in the merger trees, other data types derived from the simulation must be incorporated as well. In this work, we develop a novel interactive linked-view visualization system that focuses on simultaneously exploring dark matter halos, their hierarchical evolution, corresponding particle data, and other quantitative information. We employ a parallel remote renderer and a local merger tree selection tool so that users can analyze large data sets interactively. This allows scientists to assess their simulation code, understand inconsistencies in extracted data, and intuitively understand simulation behavior on all scales. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through a set of case studies on large-scale cosmological data from the HACC (Hardware/Hybrid Accelerated Cosmology Code) simulation framework.",

        "abstract": "The large-scale structure of the universe is comprised of virialized blob-like clusters, linear filaments, sheet-like walls and huge near empty three-dimensional voids. Characterizing the large scale universe is essential to our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies. The density range of clusters, walls and voids are relatively well separated, when compared to filaments, which span a relatively larger range. The large scale filamentary network thus forms an intricate part of the cosmic web. In this paper, we describe Felix, a topology based framework for visual exploration of filaments in the cosmic web. The filamentary structure is represented by the ascending manifold geometry of the 2-saddles in the Morse-Smale complex of the density field. We generate a hierarchy of Morse-Smale complexes and query for filaments based on the density ranges at the end points of the filaments. The query is processed efficiently over the entire hierarchical Morse-Smale complex, allowing for interactive visualization. We apply Felix to computer simulations based on the heuristic Voronoi kinematic model and the standard ACDM cosmology, and demonstrate its usefulness through two case studies. First, we extract cosmic filaments within and across cluster like regions in Voronoi kinematic simulation datasets. We demonstrate that we produce similar results to existing structure finders. Second, we extract different classes of filaments based on their density characteristics from the ACDM simulation datasets. Filaments that form the spine of the cosmic web, which exist in high density regions in the current epoch, are isolated using Felix. Also, filaments present in void-like regions are isolated and visualized. These filamentary structures are often over shadowed by higher density range filaments and are not easily characterizable and extractable using other filament extraction methodologies.",

Compared to other systems, our application reduces the restrictions on the physical assumptions, data type, and amount that is required for a reconstruction of an object's morphology. It is one of the first publicly available tools to apply interactive graphics to astrophysical modeling. The tool allows astrophysicists to provide a priori knowledge about the object by interactively defining 3D structural elements. By direct comparison of model prediction with observational data, model parameters can then be automatically optimized to fit the observation. The tool has already been successfully used in a number of astrophysical research projects.",

Here, I  demonstrate a method using standard techniques from computer graphics that avoids these problems with three-dimensional data in arbitrary coordinate systems. The method adds minimum computational cost to the display process and is suitable for both realtime, interactive content, and producing fixed rendered images and videos.

The core characteristics of the x3d pathway are that: (1) it does not rely on specific software, but rather a file format (x3d), (2) it can be implemented using fully open-source tools, and (3) article readers can access the interactive models using most main stream web browsers without the need for any additional plugins. In this article, we further demonstrate the potential of the x3d pathway to visualize data sets from optical integral field spectrographs. We use recent observations of the oxygen-rich young supernova remnant 1E 0102.2-7219 in the Small Magellanic Cloud to implement additional x3dom tools & techniques and expand the range of interactions that can be offered to article readers. In particular, we present a set of javascript functions allowing the creation and interactive handling of clip planes, effectively allowing users to take measurements of distances and angles directly from the interactive model itself.",

We attempt to generate plausible and realistic looking volumetric visualizations via a tomographic approach that exploits the spherical or axial symmetry prevalent in some relevant types of nebulae. Different types of symmetry can be implemented by using different randomized distributions of virtual cameras. Our approach is based on an iterative compressed sensing reconstruction algorithm that we extend with support for position-dependent volumetric regularization and linear equality constraints. We present a distributed multi-GPU implementation that is capable of reconstructing high-resolution datasets from arbitrary projections. Its robustness and scalability are demonstrated for astronomical imagery from the Hubble Space Telescope. The resulting volumetric data is visualized using direct volume rendering. Compared to previous approaches, our method preserves a much higher amount of detail and visual variety in the 3D visualization, especially for objects with only approximate symmetry.",

However, our fixed vantage point on Earth limits us to a single known view of these objects, and their intricate volumetric structure cannot be recovered directly. Recent approaches to reconstructing a volumetric 3D model use the approximate symmetry inherent to many nebulae, but require several hours of computation time on large multi-GPU clusters. We present a novel reconstruction algorithm based on group sparsity that reaches or even exceeds the quality of prior results while taking only a fraction of the time on a conventional desktop PC, thereby enabling end users in planetariums or educational facilities to produce high-quality content without expensive hardware or manual modeling. In principle, our approach can be generalized to other transparent phenomena with arbitrary types of user-specified symmetries.",
